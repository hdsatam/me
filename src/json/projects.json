            "description": "This is a mobile Android application that aims to provide users with better insights into their financial spending behavior. The app connects to a user's bank account and displays information on how much money they've been spending in certain categories (e.g. food and drinks, transportation, entertainment, etc). In addition, the app compares their current week's spending in these areas to past weeks to incentivize better spending habits. The app was developed in Java using Android Studio. It also utilizes the API developed by Plaid to securely connect to a user's bank account."

            "description": "This is a personal web app project that I'm working on that aims to provide users an easy way to determine what streaming services their favorite movies belong on. Users can search for any movie they'd like and it will display what streaming services they can watch it on, including links and pricing. There are many moving parts to the project. The front-end is developed using React JS with help from the React Bootstrap library. The server back-end is written in Python using Flask. A sqlite3 database is used to store the information on the movies. The application also connects to the TMDB API to get extra information on movies, such as runtime, directors, and movie posters. (Site currently down for maintenance)"

            "description": "This is a long-term passion project of mine. I'm developing an NES emulator in C++ with the goal to have it playable on as many officially released NES games as possible. Working on this has not only been a staisfying way to exercise my knowledge of Computer Architecture and Operating Systems, but it has also taught me so much about the inner workings of these complex machines. Like I said, this is a monumental task that is going to take a while to fully complete. Feel free to contact me to hear more about my progress!"

            "description": "This was a machine learning project that aimed to develop a network capable of generating passages of text that matched a specific writing style (e.g. the writing style of Edgar Allen Poe). The network was developed using PyTorch and used a pretrained GPT2 model that was fed special 'style tokens' to help the net learn the different styles."
